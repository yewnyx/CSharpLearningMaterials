    "One extremely useful way to structure one's thoughts (where programming is concerned) is to interpret the world as containing objects and their relationships. For example, in the light switch example, you have two main objects, the power switch and the power source. There is a relationship beetween the power switch and the light source: the switch is connected to the light source's light emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesn't have to be connected by behavior, though. A car might be described as a chassis, axles, and wheels. The chassis has two axles, and the axles have two wheels each. That is also a way of describing and breaking down a \"car\" into its components. A TV remote might be broken down into batteries, a circuit board, and buttons, or depending on what you're working with maybe you break it down mechanically as a plastic shell, silicone rubber buttons, a battery cover, etc. - it all depends on what is relevant to you. If you're conceerned with physical design, the physical breakdown matters. If you're designing the electronics, you may wan to describe which electronics you need instead.\n",
